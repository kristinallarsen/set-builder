We have a reproduction of an earlier state of the chart which has no soundings and is dated 1852; it says the plan of the city was taken from the map by Cooke and Le Count; there are differences in the piers and the buildings along the piers. We can find no reference for this earlier state. In the Annual Report of the Survey for 1853, another issue of the chart was published (litho) with the addition of more notes regarding tides in the upper left - this same chart was also issued (engraved on thin paper) in the collection of charts published by the survey in 1854. Map is without color."

Includes note and table of reference to public buildings. 1857 edition marked a significant improvement in the USCS's mapping of San Francisco. Prepared by A.F. Rogers, it captured the tremendous growth of the City, locating wharves, streets, buildings, roads, topographical features and places such as the Union Race Course and Pioneer Race Course, west of the City. While first issued and corrected in 1857, neither of the 1857 editions was never published in the regular annual Coast Survey reports until a revised edition, dated 1859, was issued. This chart was first issued in 1857, with another edition issued later in 1857 that differs from the earlier edition and is apparently the same as 1859 edition see our 1030). The first edition does not include soundings, has a shorter \"note\" in the top right corner, and does not include the \"Blosom rock Buoy\" which appears below the table. It also does not include the \"hydrography by Lieut. R.M. Cuyler\". OCLC locates only 3 copies of this 1857 edition at San Francisco National Maritime Museum, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and the British Library."
